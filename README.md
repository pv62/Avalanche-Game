# Avalanche-Game
Unity 3D project based on the board game "Avalanche". It can be played with 2 players or against an AI. Done for my university fourth year project.

The Board.blend and Board.fbx files are the assets created with Blender.
The Avalanche Game folder contains the game files created using Unity.

Once inside the Avalanche Game folder:-

- The code is located in the directory Assets/Scripts.

- To run the system, open the EXE folder and run the Avalanche Game.exe file.

Note: All files in the EXE folder are required to run the game.
